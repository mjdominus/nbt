* Maps have scale and position data in them.  So it wouldn't be hard to
  write a program that would take a directory full of maps (like in
  maps/ here) and stitch them together into a single map.

  o So far so good!  Now, sort the input maps in order of decreasing
    scale so that high-resolution patches are not overwritten by
    low-resolution patches

o The banner data is in there; you could easily put the banners on the
  map.  Similarly "frames".

o Maybe an external file with user-defined list of landmarks

o Maybe a command-line flag to show the boundaries of each of the
  maps?  Maybe annotate each map with its number?

o Sometimes you have two maps that cover the exact same
  territory. Only the newest one should be rendered.
