* Maps have scale and position data in them.  So it wouldn't be hard to
  write a program that would take a directory full of maps (like in
  maps/ here) and stitch them together into a single map.

  o So far so good!  Now, sort the input maps in order of decreasing
    scale so that high-resolution patches are not overwritten by
    low-resolution patches
